# ProductPriceCalc

My first ever Xamarin project in combination with MVVMCros.

My name is Maurice Markvoort and I am a graduate student at [Xablu](https://www.xablu.com).
Xablu is specialized in Xamarin App development: Xamarin App development solutions, ranging from assembling development teams and co-sourcing to creating industry-standard development environments.

I am doing a assignment related to the LoRa network. Within this repository you will find my project that is created in Visual Studio.

The project is about to calculate the price customers have to pay for there product. You can fill in the retail price and use two sliders to manage the tax and profit percentage. As final you wil see the total price.

The app is created for Android, Iphone and UWP (Universal windows platform) using the [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com) software.
MVVMCross is used as cross-platform mvvm framework that enables developers to create cross-platform apps.
